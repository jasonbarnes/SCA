Feature Extraction:

After doing triplet_extraction, you should have some
csv file with all of the extracted triplets.  Using this
file (named "trips.csv" if using the top level script), 
you can perform feature extraction using the following
steps:

Edit feature.config:
	feature.config contains configuration options for
	all of the feature extraction functions.  Most of
	the options simply turn a feature on or off. In
	the default file, featues set to 1 or 0 control
	whether a feature extractor is used, while others
	are used for configuration (like setting the total
	number of number markers).  You can add new
	options to this file and use them however you want,
	but it is a good idea to add a 0/1 option for each
	new feature extractor that you add to make it simple
	to turn them on and off.

generate_marker_info.sh [triplet file]
	This script calls all of the generate* programs.  It
	is used to determine how much memory to allocate for
	histograms in feature_extraction. This needs to be run
	for each new triplet file used.

feature_extraction [triplet file] [feature.config]
	This program performs the feature extraction.  It outputs
	a NxM csv to be used by libSVM in the next step.  Which
	features are extracted are controlled by feature.config.
