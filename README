Traffic Classifier README:

The traffic classifier works in 4 steps:
	Automatic browsing for data collection
	Turning the pcap files into csv triplets
	Applying countermeasures to the csv
	Feature extraction and classification

Automatic Browsing:
	This step can be done by following the
	instructions inside of auto_browser
	followed by the instructions in prepare.
	This step is not fully automated since it
	needs to be run very rarely.  Once you have
	a dataset, there should be no need to go through
	auto_browser or prepare unless you need a new one.

Triplet Extraction:
	This step can be done inside of triplet_extractor.
	Like the last step, it only has to be done once per
	dataset, so it does not need to be run frequently.

Countermeasures:
	This step is optional.  It takes a triplet file and
	modifies it by applying one of the countermeasure
	functions to it.

Feature Extraction and Classification:
	This step uses the multiple feature extraction
	functions to extract the features from the triplet
	file and convert it to a csv for use with libSVM.
