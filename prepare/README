prepare README

PCAP preparation:
The scripts and programs in this directory are designed
to make the pcap files captured in ../auto_browser look
like the files found in the Liberatore dataset,
including having the same names.  This way, Dyer's
traffic-framework code can be called on any pcap files
we create for verification purposes.

convert_name.sh
	This copies the files from ../auto_browser into
	this directory after changing the pcap files to 
	match the Liberatore dataset. (The script name
	should probably be changed.)

convert.sh
	This copies the files that have been converted by
	convert_name.sh to pcap-logs, so that our pcap-logs
	directory matches exactly what traffic-framwork
	(and the rest of our code) expects to see.
