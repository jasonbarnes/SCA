Triplet Extractor:

The triplet extractor is a directly modified version of
Dyer's traffic-framwork.  To run this code, open config.py
in an editor and change the line with BASE_DIR to match
the absolute path to "triplet_extractor/links".

The links directory should contain two links, one to
"prepare/pcap-logs" and one two a directory containing
"weka.jar", assuming that you've already installed WEKA by
this point.  You will have to edit these links to point
to the right locations.

Alternatively, you can make the pcap-logs link point to 
the Liberatore dataset to make it use that instead of your
data.

Once the BASE_DIR and links are correct, you can proceed by
using "main.py -h" to look at possible options for extraction.
These match completely with Dyer's traffic-framwork.  After you
have selected whatever options you want, use main.py to 
generate the triplet file.

When you use main.py to extract triplets, always use the "-d 0"
option.  This way, it will use the dataset stored in
"prepare/pcap-logs" instead of anything else.
