svm.sh trains and tests the svm automatically,
assuming that you have created "../feats/test.out"
and "../feats/train.out" already.  You can edit
svm.py to use different values for its grid search
for C and gamma.

You may have to alter the links for test.out and
train.out to match your machine's configuration.
